### **Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**

#### **Time Complexity:**
1. **Worst Case (Reverse Sorted Input):**  
   - In the worst case, every element is in descending order, requiring the maximum number of swaps.
   - Bubble Sort makes `n-1` passes, where each pass does up to `n-1` comparisons in the first pass, `n-2` in the second, and so on.
   - **T(n) = T(n-1) + (n-1) â†’ O(nÂ²)**
   - **Worst-case time complexity: O(nÂ²)**

2. **Best Case (Already Sorted Input):**  
   - In an optimized iterative version, we could stop early if no swaps occur. However, this recursive version will still make `n-1` recursive calls.
   - **Best-case time complexity: O(nÂ²)** (due to the recursive calls)

3. **Average Case Complexity:**  
   - Even with random ordering, the number of swaps remains approximately `O(nÂ²)`.
   - **Average-case time complexity: O(nÂ²)**

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **Recursive function call stack takes O(n) space** since `n-1` function calls are made before reaching the base case.
- **No extra data structures are used, so auxiliary space is O(1).**
- **Total space complexity: O(n) (due to recursion stack).**

### **Summary of Complexities:**
| Case        | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| Best Case  | O(nÂ²)          | O(n)            |
| Worst Case | O(nÂ²)          | O(n)            |
| Average Case | O(nÂ²)       | O(n)            |

ðŸ’¡ **Recursive Bubble Sort is not efficient for large datasets due to its O(nÂ²) time complexity.** However, it helps in understanding recursion better. ðŸš€
