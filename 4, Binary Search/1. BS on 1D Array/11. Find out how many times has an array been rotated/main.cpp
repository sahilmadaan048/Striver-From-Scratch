roblem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Now the array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find how many times the array has been rotated.

// We can easily observe that the number of rotations in an array is equal to the index(0-based index) of its minimum element.
// So, in order to solve this problem, we have to find the index of the minimum element.

/*

Time Complexity: O(N), N = size of the given array.
Reason: We have to iterate through the entire array to check if the target is present in the array.

Space Complexity: O(1)
Reason: We have not used any extra data structures, this makes space complexity, even in the worst case as O(1).
