/*

Given an array/list of length ‘N’, where the array/list represents the boards and each element of the given array/list represents the length of each board. Some ‘K’ numbers of painters are available to paint these boards. Consider that each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint. You are supposed to return the area of the minimum time to get this job done of painting all the ‘N’ boards under the constraint that any painter will only paint the continuous sections of boards.

/*

Time Complexity: O(N * (sum(arr[])-max(arr[])+1)), where N = size of the array, sum(arr[]) = sum of all array elements, max(arr[]) = maximum of all array elements.
Reason: We are using a loop from max(arr[]) to sum(arr[]) to check all possible values of time. Inside the loop, we are calling the countPainters() function for each number. Now, inside the countPainters() function, we are using a loop that runs for N times.

Space Complexity:  O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
