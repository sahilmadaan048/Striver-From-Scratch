/*


Time Complexity: O(N * (sum(weights[]) - max(weights[]) + 1)), where sum(weights[]) = summation of all the weights, max(weights[]) = maximum of all the weights, N = size of the weights array.
Reason: We are using a loop from max(weights[]) to sum(weights[]) to check all possible weights. Inside the loop, we are calling findDays() function for each weight. Now, inside the findDays() function, we are using a loop that runs for N times.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
