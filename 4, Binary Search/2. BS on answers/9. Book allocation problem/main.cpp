/*

 Given an array ‘arr of integer numbers, ‘ar[i]’ represents the number of pages in the ‘i-th’ book. There are a ‘m’ number of students, and the task is to allocate all the books to the students.
Allocate books in such a way that:

Each student gets at least one book.
Each book should be allocated to only one student.
Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.
You have to allocate the book to ‘m’ students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum. If the allocation of books is not possible. return -1

/*

Time Complexity: O(N * (sum(arr[])-max(arr[])+1)), where N = size of the array, sum(arr[]) = sum of all array elements, max(arr[]) = maximum of all array elements.
Reason: We are using a loop from max(arr[]) to sum(arr[]) to check all possible numbers of pages. Inside the loop, we are calling the countStudents() function for each number. Now, inside the countStudents() function, we are using a loop that runs for N times.

Space Complexity:  O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem
