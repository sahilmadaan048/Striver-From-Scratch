/*

Time Complexity: O(N/2) The algorithm traverses the linked list using the Tortoise and Hare approach. The code increments both 'slow' and 'fast' pointers at different rates, effectively covering about half the list before reaching the midpoint, hence the time complexity of the algorithm is O(N/2) ~ O(N).

Space Complexity: O(1) The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input (linked list). It doesn't use any additional data structures in proportion to the input size. Thus, the space complexity is O(1) (constant space).
